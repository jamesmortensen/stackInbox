StackInbox
==========

##Overview

A browser add-on to preserve inbox messages on Stack Exchange until they are actually read.

**extension** - This is code for the Chrome/Chromium extension. 

**stackinbox-for-firefox** - This is the code for the Firefox extension.

**userscript** - Originally, I tried writing as a userscript, but I wasn't able to sync with all *.stackexchange.com domains, so I converted to individual browser add-ons. This is here for historical references.


##Installation

For installation instructions, visit the [StackInbox page on StackApps](http://stackapps.com/q/3778/4812). For questions, you can find me either on Stack Exchange or as [@jmort253](https://twitter.com/jmort253) on Twitter.
